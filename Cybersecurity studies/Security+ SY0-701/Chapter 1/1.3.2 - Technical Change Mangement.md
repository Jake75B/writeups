- No such thing as a "simple" upgrade
	- Can have many moving parts
	- Separate events may be required

### Allow / deny list

- Any application can be dangerous
	- Vulnerabilities, trojan horses, malware
- Security policy can control app execution
	- Allow list , deny/block list
- Allow list
	- Nothing runs unless it's approved
	- Very restrictive
- Deny list
	- Nothing on the bad "list"
	- Anti-virus, anti-malware

### Restricted activities :LiCircleX:

- The scope of a change is important
	- Defines exactly which components are covered
- A change approval isn't permission to make **any** change, the approval is <mark style="background: #E59E52;">very specific</mark>

- The scope may need to be expanded during the change window
	- impossible to prepare for all possible outcomes!!  
	
- Important to have a well documented change process in place to make the change successful.

### Downtime :LiArrowBigDown:

- Usually scheduled during non-production hours
- If possible prevent any downtime
	- If unavoidable, measures such as a switch to a secondary system can be put in place
		- Upgrade the primary system, then switch back

- Process should be as automated as possible
	- Switch back to secondary if issues appear
	- Should be part of the backout plan
	
- Prepare employees by sending emails and calendar updates

### Restarts :LiTimerReset:

- Restart may be required to implement the new configuration
- Reboot OS, power cycle the device, bounce the service
- Can the system recover from a power outage????

- Servives
	- Stop and restart the service or daemon
	- May take seconds or minutes

- Applications
	- Close the application completely
	- Launch a new application instance

### Legacy applications 👵

- Applications often no longer supported by the developer
- Fear of the unknown; Document the system!
	- May be quirky, create specific processes and procedures

### Dependancies

- To complete A, complete B first
	- A service will not start without other active services
	- An application requires a specific dependancy/library version
- Modifying one component may require changing or restarting other components

- Dependancies may occur across systems
	- I.e. upgrade firewall code then upgrade firewall management software

### Documentation

- It can be challenging to keep up with changes
	- Documentation can become outdated very quickly
	- Documentation required with the change management process 
	
- Updating diagrams, modify network configurations, address updates

### Version control

- Track changes to a file or configuration data over time
- Easily revert to a previous setting

- Many opportunities to manage versions router configurations
	- I.e. Windows OS patches, Application registry entries, router configurations 

- Not always straightforward
	- Some devices and OS don't have built in version control thus require third party VCS
