## Authenticating systems

- How can you truly authenticate a device? 
	- Put a digitally signed certificate on the device
	- Other business processes rely on the certificate
	- Management software can validate the end device
## Certificate authentication

- An organisation has a trusted ***Certificate Authority (CA)***
	- A device / software responsible for managing all certificates in the environment

 - The organisation creates a certificate for a device and digitally signs it with the organisation's CA. 
- This certificate can now be included on the device as an authentication factor.
	-  The CA's digital signature is used to validate the certificate

## Authorisation models

- Without an authorisation model, problems may arise:
	- Difficult to understand why an authorisation may exist
	- Does not scale

- Associating individuals with resources (user -> model -> resource)
- Creates a clear relationship between the user and the resource
-  Streamlines administration, supports any number of user or resources

- With and without authorisation model
