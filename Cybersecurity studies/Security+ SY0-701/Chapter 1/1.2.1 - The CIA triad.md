### Confidentiality
--- 
- Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorised individuals or systems

- Encryption
- Access controls, selectively restrict access to a resource
- 2FA 
### Integrity 
---
- Messages can't be modified without detection

- Hashing
- Digital signiture
- Digital certificates
- Non-repudiation, provides proof of integrity, can be asserted to be genuine

### Availability 
--- 
- Systems and networks must be up and running
- information always available to authorised users

- Redundancy, build services that will always be available
- Fault tolerance, system will continue to run, even when a failure occurs
- Patching, stability + close security holes
