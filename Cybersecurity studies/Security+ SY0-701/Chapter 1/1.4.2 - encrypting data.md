### Encrypting stored data

- Protect data on storage devices
	- SSD, HDD, USB drive, cloud storage, etc
	- Any "data at rest"
	
- Full disk and partition/volume encryption
	- Bitlocker, Filevault, etc
- File encryption
	- EFS (Encrypting File System), third party utilities 

### Database encryption

- Protecting stored data as well as it's transmission
- Transparent encryption
	- Encrypt all database information with a symmetric key
- Record-level encryption
	- Encrypt individual columns to make access easier 
		- Avoid decryption the entire table if you wanted to access one column
		- For example only encrypting the social security number
	- Use separate symmetric keys for each column

### Transport encryption

- Protect data traversing a network
- I.e. HTTPS on a browser
- VPN 
	- Encrypts all data transmitted over a network via a tunnel regardless of application
	- Client based VPN uses SSL/TLS
	- Site to site VPN uses IPsec

### encryption algorithms 

- Countless different ways to encrypt data 
- The proper "formula" must be used during encryption and decryption
- Both sides decide on the algorithm to use before encrypting the data
