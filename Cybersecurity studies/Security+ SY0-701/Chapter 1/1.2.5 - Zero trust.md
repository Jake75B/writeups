- Many networks are relatively open on the inside
	-  once through the firewall, there are few security controls
- ***Zero trust*** is a holistic approach to network security
	- <mark style="background: #E59E52;">Covers every device, process and person </mark>
- Everything must be verified
	- Nothing is inherently trusted
- MFA, encryption, permissions, additional firewalls, monitoring 

### Planes of operation :LiPlane:

- Split the network into functional planes
- Applies to physical, virtual and cloud components

- **Data plane:**
	- Processes the frames, packets, and network data
	- Processing, forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT

- **Control plane:**
	- Manage the actions of the data plan
	- Defines policies and walls
	- Determine how packets should be forwarded
	- Routing tables, sessions tables, NAT tables

### Controlling trust

- **Adaptive identity**
	- Consider the source and requested resources
	- multiple risk indicators - relationship to the organisation, physical location, type of connection, IP address etc.
	- <mark style="background: #E59E52;">Make authentication stronger if needed</mark>

- **Threat scope reduction**
	- Decrease number of possible entry points

- **Policy-driven access control**
	- Combine the *adaptive identity* with a pre-defined set of rules

- **Security zones**
	- <mark style="background: #E59E52;">Where are you coming from and where are you going?</mark>
		- trusted, untrusted
		- internal, external network
		- VPN 1, VPN 5, VPN 11 etc
		- Marketing, IT, Accounting, HR
		
	- <mark style="background: #E59E52;">Using zones may enough by itself to deny access</mark>
	- for example, untrusted to trusted zone traffic

	- Some zones are implicitly trusted
	- For example, trusted to internal zone traffic


- **Policy enforcement point**
	- The gatekeeper
	- Allow, monitor, and terminate connections
	- can consist of multiple components working together

- **Policy Decision point**
	- Process for making an authentication decision
	
- **Policy engine** 
	- Evaluates each access decision based on policy and other information sources
	- grant, deny or revoke
	
- **Policy administrator**
	- Communicates with the policy enforcement point
	- Generate access tokens or credentials
	- Tells the PEP to allow or disallow access

### Transcript for final model

"Now we can put all of this together to create a single zero trust model, which starts with our subjects and systems communicating from an untrusted zone over the data plane and communicating through the Policy Enforcement Point.  
If there is a policy enforcement that needs to take place, this enforcement point will provide that to the Policy Administrator, which then communicates to the Policy Engine to make the decision about whether this traffic is allowed.  
That result is then passed down to the Policy Administrator, which provides that to the Policy Enforcement Point.  
And if this traffic is allowed, the Policy Enforcement Point then provides access to this trusted zone, and ultimately, the Enterprise Resource requested by the subjects or the systems."
