- Prevent security events, minimise impact and limit damage

# Control categories
### Technical controls
---
- controls implemented using systems
- operating system controls
- i.e. firewalls, anti-virus

### Managerial controls
---
- Administrative controls associated with security design and implementation
- i.e. security policies, standard operating procedures
### Operational controls
---
- Controls implemented by ***people*** instead of systems 
- i.e. security guards, awareness programs 

### Physical controls
---
- limit physical access
-  i.e. guard shack, fences, locks, badge readers

# Control types 

### Preventive controls
---
- Block access to a resource 
- prevent access:
	- firewall rules
	- follow security policy
	- check ID's
	- enable door locks
### Deterrent 
---
- Discourage an intrusion attempt (does not directly prevent access)
- Make an attacker think twice:
	- Application splash screen
	- Front reception desk
	- Warning signs

### Detective
---
- Identify and log intrusion attempts (may not prevent access)
- Find the issue
	- Collect and review system logs
	- Review login reports
	- Patrolling property
	- Motion detectors
	
### Corrective
---
- Apply a control after an event has been detected (reverse impact of event)
- Continue operating with minimum downtime 
- Correct the problem
	- Restoring from backups can mitigate ransomware infection
	- create polices for reporting security issues
	- Contact law enforcement to manage criminal activity 
	- Use a fire extinguisher 

### Compensating
---
- Control using other means (Existing controls not sufficient)
- May be temporary 
- Prevent the exploitation of a weakness
	- Firewall blocks a specific application instead of patching app
	- Implement a separation of duties (limit scope of security concern)
	- Simultaneous guard duties (no single guard has complete access)
	- Backup power generator 

### Directive 
---
- Direct a subject towards security compliance (direct towards more secure over less)
- Relatively weak control
- I.e. Do this please:
	- Store all sensitive files in a protected folder
	- Create compliance policies and procedures
	- Train users on proper security policy
	- Put up sign on door saying "authorised personal only"

# Managing security controls
---
- These are not inclusive lists
	- There are many categories of control
	- Some organisations will combine types
	- Some controls may exist in multiple categories or types
	- New controls are created as systems and processes evolve
	- varies between organisations
