- Policies, procedures, hardware, software, people
	- Digital certificates: create, distribute, manage, store, revoke
	- Lot's of planning involved
- Also refers to the binding of public keys to people or devices
	- Certificate Authority (CA)

### Symmetric encryption

- A single shared key ("Shared secret")
	- Encrypt with the same key
	- Decrypt with the same key

- **Pros:** Very fast to use, less overhead then asymmetric
-  **Cons:** Doesn't scale very well, can be challenging to distribute 

- Often combined with asymmetric 

### Asymmetric encryption

- Two (or more) mathematically related keys created at the same time
- One private key, one person/device has access to
- One public key, Given to everyone

- <mark style="background: #E59E52;">The private key is the only key that can decrypt data encrypted with the public key</mark>
	- You can't derive the private key from the public key despite a mathematical relation

### Key generation

- Build both private and public key at the same time
- Lot's of randomisation
- Involves large prime numbers, lots and lots of maths

### Key escrow

- Private keys in hands of a third party
	- Business might need access to employee information in case they leave company etc
	- Government agencies may need to decrypt partner data
