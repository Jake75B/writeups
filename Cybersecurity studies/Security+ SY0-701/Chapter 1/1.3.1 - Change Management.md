- **Have clear policies**
	- Frequency, duration, installation process, rollback procedures 

- **A formal process for managing change**
	- Avoid downtime, confusion, mistakes
	
---
### A typical approval process

- Complete request forms
- Determine the purpose of the change
- Identify the scope of the change (1 system, multiple systems etc)
- Date time
- Determine affected systems and impact
- analyse risk associated with change

--- 

### Ownership

- An individual or entity needs to make a change
- They own the change control process, they don't usually perform the actual change
- Instead the owner manages the process, updates are provided to the owner ensuring the process is followed and is acceptable

*For example:*

- Address label printers need to be upgraded
- Shipping and receiving department owns the process
- IT handles the actual upgrade to the printing software

**Stakeholders**

- They'll want to have an input on the change management process
- A single change can include one individual or even the entire company

*For example:*

- Shipping/receiving department
- Accounting department for reports
- Customer , change in product delivery timeframes
- CEO, potential revenue change 

--- 
### Impact analysis

- Determine a risk value, I.e. high, medium, low

- **Risk can be minor or far reaching**
	- "Fix" doesn't fix anything
	- Fix breaks something else 
	- data corruption
	- Operating system failure
	
- **What's the risk with not making the change?**
	- Security vulnerability
	- Application unavailability
	- Unexpected downtime to other services that rely on it

--- 
### Testing

- No connection to real world or production system
	- A technological safe space

- Try the upgrade, apply the patch, test and confirm before deployment
	- Confirm the contingency plan, simulate change revert

- "Prepare for the worst, hope for the best"
	- Always have good backups

--- 
### Maintenance window 

- During workday may not be the best option
	- Overnights are often the best choice but challenging for 24/7 office operation types
	- Retail networks frozen during holiday season
