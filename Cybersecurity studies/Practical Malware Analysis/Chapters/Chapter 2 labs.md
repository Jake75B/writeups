This lab uses the files `Lab01-01.exe` and `Lab01-01.dll`. Use the tools and techniques described in the chapter to gain information about the files and answer the questions below.

1. Upload the files to http://www.VirusTotal.com/ and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures? 




2.  **When were these files compiled?**
