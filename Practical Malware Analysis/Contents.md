[[Chapter 1 -  Malware Analysis primer]] establishes the overall process and methodology of analysing malware.

**Chapter 2** teaches ways to get information from an executable without running it.

**Chapter 3** walks you through setting up virtual machines to use as a safe environment for running malware.

**Chapter 4** teaches easy-to-use but effective techniques for analysing a malicious program by running it.

**Chapter 5** _“A Crash Course in x86 Assembly”_ is an introduction to the x86 assembly language, which provides a foundation for using IDA Pro and performing in-depth analysis of malware.

**Chapter 6** shows you how to use IDA Pro, one of the most important malware analysis tools. We’ll use IDA Pro throughout the remainder of the book.

**Chapter 7** provides examples of C code in assembly and teaches you how to understand the high-level functionality of assembly code.

**Chapter 8** covers a wide range of Windows-specific concepts that are necessary for understanding malicious Windows programs.

**Chapter 9** explains the basics of debugging and how to use a debugger for malware analysts.

**Chapter 10** shows you how to use OllyDbg, the most popular debugger for malware analysts.

**Chapter 11** covers how to use the WinDbg debugger to analyse kernel-mode malware and rootkits.

**Chapter 12** describes common malware functionality and shows you how to recognise that functionality when analysing malware.

**Chapter 13** discusses how to analyse a particularly stealthy class of malicious programs that hide their execution within another process.

**Chapter 14** demonstrates how malware may encode data in order to make it harder to identify its activities in network traffic or on the victim host.

**Chapter 15** teaches you how to use malware analysis to create network signatures that outperform signatures made from captured traffic alone.

**Chapter 16** explains how some malware authors design their malware so that it is hard to disassemble, and how to recognise and defeat these techniques.

**Chapter 17** describes the tricks that malware authors use to make their code difficult to debug and how to overcome those roadblocks.

**Chapter 18** demonstrates techniques used by malware to make it difficult to analyse in a virtual machine and how to bypass those techniques.

**Chapter 19** teaches you how malware uses packing to hide its true purpose, and then provides a step-by-step approach for unpacking packed programs.

**Chapter 20** explains what shellcode is and presents tips and tricks specific to analysing malicious shellcode.

**Chapter 21** instructs you on how C++ code looks different once it is compiled and how to perform analysis on malware created using C++.

**Chapter 22** discusses why malware authors may use 64-bit malware and what you need to know about the differences between x86 and x64.

**Appendix A** briefly describes Windows functions commonly used in malware.

**Appendix B** lists useful tools for malware analysts.

**Appendix C** provides the solutions for the labs included in the chapters throughout the book.
